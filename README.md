# Jam.brussels

A webapp to centeralize information about jam sessions in Brussels in one place. View when, where, what type and who is opening a jam session without having to create an account.

## Why?

I dislike Facebook, I dislike having to have certain people friended or needing to be in certain groups to see when and where jam sessions are being held. I dislike having to scroll through heaps and heaps of ads to find a event, or only to finally see I sessions I was looking forward to, only for it to have passed since it was buried enough 30 ads.

Yeah, not a fan of this kind of thing. So yeah, without this made, I can finally cut ties with Facebook and fill my agenda with jam sessions without issue.

## Design

UX Design is being conceived over [here](https://www.figma.com/file/gNKtt6HTorugMfGsUuNakR/jam.brussels?node-id=0%3A1) on Figma. Feel free to provide feedback or make suggestions in the issues tab of this page.
